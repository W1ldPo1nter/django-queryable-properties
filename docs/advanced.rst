=================

The :ref:`common:Common patterns` section of the documentation refers to property implementations that are essentially
simple and common wrappers around existing Django features internally, such as ``Case``/``When``, subqueries, etc.
The *django-queryable-properties* features described here are more advanced and go beyond the things that Django offers
on its own.
