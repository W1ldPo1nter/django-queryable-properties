Common properties
=================

*django-queryable-properties* offers some fully implemented properties for common code patterns out of the box.
All of them are class-based and parametrizable for their specific use case (while still supporting all
:ref:`basics:Common property arguments`) and are supposed to help remove boilerplate for recurring types of properties
while making them usable in querysets at the same time.
