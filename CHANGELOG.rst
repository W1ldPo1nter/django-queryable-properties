Changelog
=========

master (unreleased)
-------------------

1.6.0 (2021-04-06)
------------------

- Added support for Django 3.2
- Queryable properties can now define a verbose name that can be used in UI representations
- Added a Django admin integration that allows to reference queryable properties like regular model fields in various
  admin options
- Fixed the construction of ``GROUP BY`` clauses when using annotations based on aggregate queryable properties in
  Django 1.8

1.5.0 (2020-12-30)
------------------

- Added an option to implement annotation-based properties that use their annotation to query their getter value from
  the database
- Added a new ready-to-use queryable property implementation for properties that check whether or not certain related
  objects exist (``RelatedExistenceCheckProperty``)
- Added a new ready-to-use queryable property implementation for properties that map field/attribute values to other
  values (``MappingProperty``)

1.4.1 (2020-10-21)
------------------

- String representations of queryable properties do now contain the full Python path instead of the Django model path
  (also fixes an error that occurred when building the string representation for a property on an abstract model that
  was defined outside of the installed apps)

1.4.0 (2020-10-17)
------------------

- ``ValueCheckProperty`` and ``RangeCheckProperty`` objects can now take more complex attribute paths instead of simple
  field/attribute names
- ``RangeCheckProperty`` objects now have an option that determines how to treat missing values to support ranges with
  optional boundaries
- Added a new ready-to-use queryable property implementation for properties based on simple aggregates
  (``AggregateProperty``)

1.3.1 (2020-08-04)
------------------

- Added support for Django 3.1
- Refactored decorator-based properties to be more maintainable and memory-efficient and documented a way to use them
  without actually decorating

1.3.0 (2020-05-22)
------------------

- Added an option to implement simplified custom boolean filters utilizing lookup-based filters
- Fixed the ability to use the ``classmethod`` or ``staticmethod`` decorators with lookup-based filter methods for
  decorator-based properties
- Fixed the queryable property resolution in ``When`` parts of conditional updates
- Fixed the ability to use conditional expressions directly in ``.filter``/``.exclude`` calls in Django 3.0

1.2.1 (2019-12-03)
------------------

- Added support for Django 3.0

1.2.0 (2019-10-21)
------------------

- Added a mixin that allows custom filters for queryable properties (both class- and decorator-based) to be implemented
  using multiple functions/methods for different lookups
- Added some ready-to-use queryable property implementations (``ValueCheckProperty``, ``RangeCheckProperty``) to
  simplify common code patterns
- Added a standalone version of six to the package requirements

1.1.0 (2019-06-23)
------------------

- Queryable property filters (both annotation-based and custom) can now be used across relations when filtering
  querysets (i.e. a queryset can now be filtered by a queryable property on a related model)
- Queryset annotations can now refer to annotatable queryable properties defined on a related model
- Querysets can now be ordered by annotatable queryable properties defined on a related model
- Filters and annotations that reference annotatable queryable properties will not select the queryable property
  annotation anymore in Django versions below 1.8 (ordering by such a property will still lead to a selection in these
  versions)
- Fixed unnecessary selections of queryable property annotations in querysets that don't return model instances (i.e.
  queries with ``.values()`` or ``.values_list()``)
- Fixed unnecessary fields in ``GROUP BY`` clauses in querysets that don't return model instances (i.e. queries with
  ``.values()`` or ``.values_list()``) in Django versions below 1.8
- Fixed an infinite recursion when constructing the ``HAVING`` clause for annotation-based filters that are not an
  aggregate in Django 1.8

1.0.2 (2019-06-02)
------------------

- The ``lookup`` parameter of custom filter implementations of queryable properties will now receive the combined
  lookup string if multiple lookups/transforms are used at once instead of just the first lookup/transform
- Fixed the construction of ``GROUP BY`` clauses when annotating queryable properties based on aggregates
- Fixed the construction of ``HAVING`` clauses when annotating queryable properties based on aggregates in Django
  versions below 1.9
- Fixed the ability to pickle queries and querysets with queryable properties functionality in Django versions below
  1.6

1.0.1 (2019-05-11)
------------------

- Added support for Django 2.2

1.0.0 (2018-12-31)
------------------

- Initial release
